## General info
It is one of the Data Analysing projects which is suppoused to hone my skills in that category.

Main goals of the project were:
* How to spot relationships in a dataset using Seaborn's .pairplot()
* How to split data into a training and testing dataset to better evaluate a model's performance.
* How to run a multivariable regression.
* How to evaluate the regression model using (a log) data transformation.
* How to use model to make a prediction.

As a notebook I used Datalore from Jetbrains.

It's one of the projects from [Angela's Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
